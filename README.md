# Java-Basic

This repository contains small projects and fundamental concepts that Iâ€™ll be working on while learning **Java**.  
It serves as a personal space to track my progress and practice core programming ideas.

## ðŸ“˜ Projects

### 1. Area of a Rectangle
A simple Java program that calculates the **area of a rectangle** using user-provided length and breadth.

**Concepts used:**
- Taking user input using `Scanner`
- Basic arithmetic operations
- Printing output to the console

### 2. Mad Libs Game
A fun **Mad Libs** program that asks the user for different types of words (like nouns, verbs, and adjectives) and then inserts them into a short story template to create a funny and random story.

**Concepts used:**
- Working with `Scanner` for user input  
- String concatenation and formatting  
- Basic understanding of variables and data types

### 3. Shopping Cart Program
A basic **Shopping Cart** program that lets the user enter the name of an item, its price, and the quantity they wish to buy.  
The program then calculates and displays the total amount the user needs to pay.

**Concepts used:**
- Taking user input using `Scanner`  
- Performing arithmetic calculations  
- Working with variables of different data types  
- Output formatting with `System.out.println()`

### 4. Random Number Generator
A simple **Random Number Generator** program that demonstrates how to use Javaâ€™s `Random` class to produce random values.

**What it does:**
- Generates a random integer between 1 and 6 (simulating a dice roll)  
- Generates a random double between 0 and 1  
- Simulates a coin toss using random boolean values  

**Concepts used:**
- Importing and using the `java.util.Random` class  
- Working with different data types (`int`, `double`, `boolean`)  
- Conditional statements (`if-else`)
